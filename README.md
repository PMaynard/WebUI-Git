# WebUI-Git
Web interface for git written in node.js

## Notes
1. Ensure SSH keys are correctly configured.

## Usage
```
clone
pull
pull?branch=master
```

## ToDo
1. Pull Newest version
2. Setup Configuration files
3. Run setup scripts
	run ?generate on all pages.
4. View Logs


## Suggestions
1. Re-write to use libgit2 node bindings (gitteh). Did not originally use due to gitteh being abandoned and examples causing segmentation fault.
2. Integrate [log.io](https://github.com/NarrativeScience/Log.io)
